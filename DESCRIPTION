Description: This package contains 77 different color palettes inspired by the queens of RuPaul's drag race. Now you can color your graphs in drag! As a long time drag fan and drag queen myself, I thought it would be a fun way for me to learn more about R while also implementing something I can actually use in my own work. Example code under ggplot: scale_fill_DragQueen(palette='Shea Coulee')
